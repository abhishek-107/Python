# Diwali Sales Analysis - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project aims to analyze and gain insights from a dataset containing Diwali sales data. The dataset used in this project was sourced from the YouTube channel of Rishabh Mishra.

# Project Description

In this Python project, we perform various data cleaning and processing tasks to prepare the Diwali sales dataset for analysis. We utilize popular Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn for exploratory data analysis.

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

* Perform data cleaning and preprocessing: This involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, standardizing formats, and addressing any other inconsistencies in the dataset.

* Conduct exploratory data analysis: Utilizing the power of numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, we explore the dataset to gain insights into various aspects of Diwali sales. We analyze trends, patterns, correlations, and distributions within the data.

* Derive meaningful insights: Based on our analysis, we extract valuable information and draw conclusions about Diwali sales. These insights could be related to sales performance, customer behavior, popular products, or any other significant findings.

To run this project locally and perform your own exploratory data analysis, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository: Use the following command to clone this repository to your local machine.

* Install dependencies: Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, install the required Python libraries by running the following command.

* Obtain the dataset: You can find the Diwali sales dataset on the YouTube channel of Rishabh Mishra (https://www.youtube.com/@RishabhMishraOfficial). Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate location within the project directory.

* Run the Jupyter Notebook: Open the Jupyter Notebook file (Diwali_Sales_Analysis.ipynb) and execute each cell to perform the data analysis step-by-step. Feel free to modify the notebook or add your own code as needed.

* Explore the results: Once the notebook has been executed, you can explore the visualizations and insights derived from the Diwali sales dataset.

# Conclusion

Through this exploratory data analysis of Diwali sales data, we have gained valuable insights into various aspects of sales performance, customer behavior on basis of gender, and product popularity during the festival. By leveraging the power of Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, we were able to analyze the dataset effectively.

We hope that this project inspires you to perform your own data analysis and discover interesting patterns and trends within the dataset. Feel free to build upon this project and extend the analysis further.
