# Spotify Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis using Python on music-related datasets, specifically data obtained from Spotify, the world's largest audio streaming platform. The goal of this project is to provide a practical understanding of how to analyze Spotify data using Python libraries and tools.

# Project Overview

In this project, we explore and analyze music-related data from Spotify to gain insights into various aspects such as song attributes, popularity, and trends. We will utilize Python programming language and several libraries to manipulate, visualize, and interpret the data. The key libraries used in this project include:

* NumPy: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python, providing support for arrays, mathematical functions, and more.
* Pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library that provides data structures such as DataFrames, allowing for easy handling and analysis of structured data.
* Matplotlib: A plotting library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.
* Seaborn: A data visualization library built on top of Matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics.

# Data Source

The datasets used in this project were obtained from Kaggle, a popular platform for sharing and discovering datasets. The specific dataset links are as follows:

* Dataset 1: Spotify Audio Features - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-db?resource=download
* Dataset 2: Top Spotify Tracks of 2018 - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lehaknarnauli/spotify-datasets?select=tracks.csv

Please ensure that you download these datasets and place them in the appropriate location before running the code.
